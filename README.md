# YelpCamp
YelpCamp, a full-stack web application, enables users to create and review campgrounds. An account is a prerequisite for campground interactions. I developed this with the help of Colt Steele's Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp. I used Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and incorporated Passport.js for seamless authentication.
The main features are login, sign-up and Create, Edit, Update, Delete (CRUD) for campgrounds, comments, and reviews. Create routes have authentication. Edit, Update, and Delete routes have authentication and authorization.
