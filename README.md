# YelpCamp
 YelpCamp, a full-stack website, enables users to create and review campgrounds. An account is a prerequisite for campground interactions. I developed this with the help of Colt Steele's Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp. I used Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap, and incorporated Passport.js for seamless authentication.
